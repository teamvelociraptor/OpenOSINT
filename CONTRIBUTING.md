# Contributing to OpenOSINT

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document covers the development
workflow and the checklist for adding new integrations.

Before contributing, read [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md). OpenOSINT is for
authorized security research and educational use only.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Lint and format
ruff check openosint/
ruff format openosint/
```

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Write tests first; implementation follows. Target 80% coverage on new code.
3. Run `pytest` and `ruff check` before opening a pull request.
4. Use the pull request template — fill in the summary, type of change, and
   checklist before requesting review.

## Adding a new integration

A "tool" in OpenOSINT is a Python module in `openosint/tools/` that exposes an
`async def run_*_osint(...)` coroutine. Adding a new tool requires registering
it in every interface layer:

| Layer | File | What to do |
|-------|------|------------|
| Tool module | `openosint/tools/search_<name>.py` | Implement `run_<name>_osint` |
| Agentic loop | `openosint/agent.py` | Import the function; add a tool definition to the tools list and a dispatch branch in the tool executor |
| MCP server | `openosint/mcp_server.py` | Import the function; add an entry to the tool registry dict |
| CLI | `openosint/cli.py` | Add a subcommand (argparse) that calls the tool directly |
| REPL | `openosint/repl.py` | Add the tool to the displayed tool list and any command completion |
| Web UI | `openosint/web_server.py` | Add the tool to the tool dispatch map used by the web endpoint |

### Environment variable convention

If the integration requires an API key, follow this naming pattern:

```
<SERVICE_NAME>_API_KEY
```

Examples: `SHODAN_API_KEY`, `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`, `CENSYS_API_ID`.

Add the new variable to `.env.example` with a comment explaining where to obtain
it, and document it in the environment variables table in `README.md` and
`CLAUDE.md`.

### Tests

Add at least one test for the new tool in `tests/`. The test should:

- Cover the happy path (valid input, expected output format).
- Cover the error path (missing binary, API error, timeout).
- Mock external HTTP calls or subprocesses — do not make live network requests
  in the test suite.

### Integrations table

Add a row for the new service to the Integrations table in `README.md` with the
service name, URL, tool name, and tier (`Community`).
